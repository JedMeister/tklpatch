===================
v0.93 Release Notes
===================

- support applying patch in running system
  for example: tklpatch-apply / patch.tar.gz

  gotcha: running system must be configured for tklpatch expected state,
          unless ofcourse the patch checks for discrepancies
          e.g., services, passwords, etc.
