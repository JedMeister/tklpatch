===================
v0.92 Release Notes
===================

* prepare-cdroot cdroot-dir argument is now optional

  rational:
      - support more use cases (e.g., using tklpatch to package a rootfs that
        was not extracted from an iso using tklpatch-extractiso)

      - if cdroot-dir is not provided, a minimal isolinux.cfg will be created
        to automatically boot the image


* added support for configuration hooks (advanced usage)

  Advanced usage (configuration hooks):
  
      The configuration script 'conf' can be replaced with a conf directory
      containing the following configuration script hooks to be executed in
      the chroot (rootfs):
  
          conf/pre-debs       # executed before apply-debs
          conf/post-debs      # executed after apply-debs
          conf/pre-overlay    # executed before apply-overlay
          conf/post-overlay   # executed after apply-overlay
  
  This is a backwards compatible change, and is optional.


* added DRY (don't repeat yourself) support when using configuration
  hooks

      - provides ability to include generic helper functions or scripts (DRY)
      - for example:
          - functions file that includes code snippets common to several hooks
          - modularization, cleaner implementation, code re-use
